# Practical-Assignment
This Java application is a series management system that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on television series data. The system includes a console-based menu interface where users can capture new series entries, search for existing series, update age restrictions, delete series records, and generate comprehensive reports. The application follows object-oriented principles with separate classes for business logic (Series), data model (SeriesModel), and main execution (Main1). Comprehensive unit testing is implemented using JUnit 4 to ensure functionality and validate age restriction rules (2-18 years). The system provides input validation and user confirmation prompts for critical operations like deletion.
