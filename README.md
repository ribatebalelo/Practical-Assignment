# Practical-Assignment

# SECTION A
This Java application is a series management system that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on television series data. The system includes a console-based menu interface where users can capture new series entries, search for existing series, update age restrictions, delete series records, and generate comprehensive reports. The application follows object-oriented principles with separate classes for business logic (Series), data model (SeriesModel), and main execution (Main1). Comprehensive unit testing is implemented using JUnit 4 to ensure functionality and validate age restriction rules (2-18 years). The system provides input validation and user confirmation prompts for critical operations like deletion.

#SECTION B
This Student Management System is a comprehensive Java application designed to manage student records, course information, and academic grades. The system follows object-oriented principles with proper encapsulation through classes like Student, Course, and Grade, which extends Course to include scoring functionality. The StudentManager class serves as the core component, handling operations such as adding students, recording grades, calculating GPAs, and generating reports. The console-based StudentManagementApp provides an interactive interface for users to perform these operations seamlessly.

The application includes a robust suite of JUnit 4 tests that ensure code reliability and functionality. These unit tests comprehensively validate constructor methods, getter/setter operations, business logic for grade calculations, GPA computations, and edge cases like handling non-existent students or empty grade lists. The test suite demonstrates strong test coverage with focused tests for each class, ensuring that the grading system produces accurate letter grades (A-F) and corresponding grade points (4.0-0.0), while the GPA calculation correctly weights courses by their credit values.
